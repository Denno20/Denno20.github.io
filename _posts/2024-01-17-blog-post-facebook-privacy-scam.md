## Stop sharing this Facebook Privacy Scam - **It's a hoax**


**A somewhat recycled Facebook hoax has been making the rounds recently, and a surprising number of the general public are still falling for it (at least, on my feed that's happening).**

The hoax post makes the claim that Facebook is about to expose your past and future photos, information, posts or even messages. While the language of the hoax has slightly varied, it looks similar to this:

> "I do not give Facebook or any company affiliated with Facebook permission to use my past and future photos, information, messages or posts. With this statement, I inform Facebook that it is strictly forbidden to publish, copy, distribute or take any other action against me based on this profile and/or its contents. The violation of privacy can be punished by law.
> NOTICE: Facebook is now a public entity. All members must publish such a note.
> Whoever wants can copy and paste this version. Failure to post a statement at least once will be tacitly allowing the use of your photos, as well as information in profile and status."

Oh dear. Have users seriously forgotten that when they created an account, they gave permission to Facebook to access their private information as per their privacy policies and legal terms? 

At least, to **some capacity**.

Facebook states in its privacy [policy](https://facebook.com/privacy/policy) that it collects information based on your activity, stating that "the information that we collect and process about you depends on how you use our products". According to the updated data policy effective since the 27th of December, Meta will collect the following information:
-   The information that you give us when you sign up for our Products and create a profile, such as your email address or phone number.
-   What you do on our Products. This includes what you click on or like, your posts and photos and messages that you send. If you use end-to-end encrypted messaging, we can't read those messages unless users report them to us for review.
-   Who your friends or followers are, and what they do on our Products.
-   Information from the phone, computer or tablet that you use our Products on, like what kind it is and what version of our app you're using.
-   Information from [partners[3]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/#annotation-3) about things you do both on and off our Products. This could include other websites you visit, apps you use or online games you play.

The hoax post a waste of everyone's time. Sharing it will not only make you look like a fool, it also won't make the slightest difference to your privacy settings, or the way Meta uses your data.

However, given the inducing fear of the language used, it's no wonder that this hoax is spreading faster than I can scroll on my news feed. 

## What steps should users take?

First of all, if you prefer a photo to remain totally private, **don't upload it.** It's a good idea to thoroughly examine your profile from a public perspective and ask yourself "Do I want people to see this?". If not, delete it. Make sure your privacy settings are **updated**, as this way you will keep some control over your personal data. 

If that is not satisfactory, **delete Facebook.**

I hope I have made you think about how preposterous this hoax post is, for all the given reasons in this article, and remember that with Facebook, you are not the customer, but rather the product. Happy scrolling :)
